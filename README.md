NOTE: libgen.io can sometimes be slow to respond. This is due to the site's limited resources and huge traffic. Please do not lose patience. Your download will generally be completed within 3 minutes. If you are thinking that "If this program takes 3 minutes to download the book, why shouldn't I visit the website and download it myself?", then remember that the program is taking longer than usual to download the book because the website is slow and if you download the book manually it will take you more time than the program itself.
